Developed an Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) Car Simulation in a 3D virtual city using JavaScript and Artificial Intelligence as part of our final year engineering curriculum. This project aimed to replicate real-world autonomous driving behaviors and safety mechanisms within a smart city environment.

Key Highlights:

🏙️ 3D Environment Design: Modeled an interactive city layout featuring roads, intersections, traffic signals, buildings, and dynamic vehicles.

🧠 AI Integration: Implemented AI for autonomous vehicle movement, including route following, obstacle detection, traffic signal response, and decision-making logic.

📍 Smart Navigation: Used Dijkstra’s Algorithm to compute the shortest and most efficient path between destinations in real-time.

🚧 Obstacle Handling: Developed logic for real-time obstacle detection and rerouting to ensure smooth, intelligent navigation.

👨‍💻 Team Collaboration: Collaborated effectively with teammates for planning, coding, debugging, and final deployment using modern software development practices.

🚗 Real-World Simulation: Simulated practical ADAS features like lane following, signal-based stopping, and dynamic path adjustment to reflect future autonomous driving technologies.

This project not only demonstrated the practical application of AI and algorithms in vehicle automation but also significantly strengthened our skills in software development, teamwork, system simulation, and real-world problem solving.
